## Overview
This is the popuar game of ROAD FIGHTER made purely in C++ using the C graphics library
just as a fun activity during my first year. It uses the system clock to randomly generate the cars 
every time the program is executed the speed is increased quarterly
and the objective of the player is to complete the path with the given 3 lives
