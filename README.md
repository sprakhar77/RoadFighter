# ROAD-FIGHTER
this is the popuar game of ROAD FIGHTER made purely in C++...using the C graphics library....
just as a fun activity during my first year...it uses the system clock to randomly generate the cars ...
every time the program is executed...the speed is increased..quarterly...
and the objective of the player is to complete the path...with the given 3 lives...
